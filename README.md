# StreetEasy Apartment Tracker (SET)

A Python script that monitors StreetEasy apartment listings and sends email notifications when new apartments matching your criteria are found.

## Features
- **Automated monitoring**: Runs every 5 minutes to check for new listings (configurable)
- **Email notifications**: Beautiful HTML emails with apartment images and details
- **Duplicate prevention**: Uses SQLite database to track seen listings
- **Price filtering**: Clean price extraction from StreetEasy listings
- **Robust scraping**: Handles rate limiting and website changes

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection
- Gmail account (or other SMTP email provider)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd apartment-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 3. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

For Gmail, you need to set up an App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Click "2-Step Verification" ‚Üí "App passwords"
   - Select "Mail" and generate password
   - Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
3. **Update .env file**:
   ```
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
   TO_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
   ```

### 4. Customize Your Search

Update the `SE_URL` in your `.env` file with your StreetEasy search criteria:

```
# Example: Studio/1BR under $3000 in Manhattan
SE_URL=https://streeteasy.com/for-rent/nyc/price:-3000|beds%3C=1|area:106

# Example: 2BR under $4000 in Brooklyn
SE_URL=https://streeteasy.com/for-rent/brooklyn/price:-4000|beds:2
```

### 5. Run the Tracker

```bash
python apartment_tracker.py
```

The script will:
- Check for new listings immediately
- Continue checking every 5 minutes
- Send email notifications for new apartments
- Store listings in `apartments.db` to prevent duplicates

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## Database Queries

View stored apartments:
```bash
# All apartments
sqlite3 apartments.db "SELECT title, price, address FROM apartments;"

# Recent apartments (last 24 hours)
sqlite3 apartments.db "SELECT title, price, first_seen FROM apartments WHERE first_seen > datetime('now', '-1 day');"

# Count by price range
sqlite3 apartments.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as count, price FROM apartments GROUP BY price ORDER BY count DESC;"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues
- Ensure 2FA is enabled and App Password is generated
- Check email credentials in `.env` file
- Verify SMTP settings for your email provider

### No Listings Found
- Check if StreetEasy URL is accessible
- Website structure may have changed (selectors need updating)
- Rate limiting (script includes retry logic)

### Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database (deletes all stored listings)
rm apartments.db
```
